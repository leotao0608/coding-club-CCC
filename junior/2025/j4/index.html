The key to helping Jeremy determine the maximum possible number of consecutive days with sunshine is to 
develop an algorithm. Of course, you then need to implement the algorithm, but to maintain focus, it can be
very helpful to separate these two tasks.
To solve the first subtask, it is useful to count the number of S characters. It is then tempting to say 
that the correct answer is one more than this total. This is correct except for one special case. If there
are no P characters, then the answer is N-1 corresponding to when the data is incorrect for the first day 
or last day.

The simplest algorithm to solve the general problem is probably to read and store the entire input, and 
consider the N possible cases for the one day that the data is incorrect. For each of these cases, you can
first "flip" the corresponding S to P or vice versa and then scan the result for the longest sequence of S
characters. This approach can earn full marks for the first two subtasks but will be too slow for the last
subtask when N can be as large as 500000. In general, if an outer loop iterates this many times and for each
iteration an inner loop also processes this much data, the algorithm will probably be too slow. Sometimes
the inner loop can be hidden inside a built-in function. For example, search functions and string 
concatenation are notorious for slowing code down in this way.

We can avoid this slowdown and solve the last subtask by processing the data only once. Ignoring the special
case of only S characters, the maximum possible number of consecutive days with sunshine will be the length
of the longest string that consists of either (i) only S characters preceded or followed by exactly one P 
character, or (ii) only S characters followed by exactly one P character followed by another string of only
S characters. To find the longest such string, there are parallels to J3 in that you more or less need to 
tokenize the input into blocks of S characters and blocks of P characters. If you wish, you can store the
lengths of these blocks instead of the blocks themselves. Regardless, since we only need to consider up to
three blocks in a row, all this can be done in one loop without too many steps per iteration.
